# Cplusplus-Program
Project Reflection

This project involved building GroceryTracker, a program designed to help users track and analyze the frequency of grocery items purchased. It solved the problem of manually remembering or recording grocery purchases by providing a simple way to review and visualize shopping habits using file input/output and frequency analysis.

I believe I did particularly well in organizing my code into logical sections and making the user interaction smooth and intuitive. I also implemented clear menu options and error handling to guide the user experience and prevent crashes due to invalid inputs.

One area where I could enhance GroceryTracker is by optimizing how the program processes and stores data, such as using maps for faster lookups instead of iterating through lists. This would make the program more efficient, especially with larger grocery datasets, and improve scalability for future feature additions.

The most challenging part of GroceryTracker was writing the file input/output logic correctly so that item frequencies were accurately read, updated, and saved without data loss. I overcame this by carefully testing file operations and consulting resources like cplusplus.com, Stack Overflow, and example C++ programs. These resources are now part of my support network for future projects.

This project strengthened my skills in file handling, menu-driven programming, data validation, and basic frequency analysisâ€”all of which are highly transferable to other projects, especially those involving databases, reporting tools, or user interface development.

I maintained clean and consistent naming conventions, added meaningful comments, and modularized the code by separating key functionalities into their own functions. I also avoided hardcoding values, making it easier to adjust or expand GroceryTracker if new features are needed later.
